## 🛠️ Model Architecture
ECG-Net uses a hybrid approach to capture both the shape and the timing of heartbeats:
* **1D CNN Layers:** Extract spatial features and morphology (e.g., QRS complex).
* **BiLSTM Layers:** Map temporal dependencies and rhythm patterns over time.
* **Optimization:** Adam optimizer with categorical cross-entropy loss.
